## Particle-Flow Reconstruction with GNN
Exercise notebook based on the model featured in "MLPF: Efficient machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction using graph neural networks" https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08578.
We explore the formulation of the different part of the model designed for particle-flow reconstruction.
